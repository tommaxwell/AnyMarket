	<div class="steps">
		<h4>Step 1: Add your item</h4>
		<p>Fill out the form to the left with as much detail about your item as possible. Title it, write a description, preferable times & places to meet, add a photo, and choose a category. Then click "List!" and your item will be for sale on AnyMarket.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="steps">
		<h4>Step 2: Answer any questions about your item</h4>
		<p>If someone has a question about the item you've listed, you'll receive the question in the email inbox associated with your AnyMarket account, along with a link to where you can reply. Be sure to check often for new questions!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="steps">
		<h4>Step 3: Coordinate a meeting time & place with your buyer</h4>
		<p>Once your item has been sold, you and the buyer of your item will be connected via email to organize a meeting time and place. Please be sure to set a time and make the trade as soon as possible. We'll hold the money for 7 business days before sending it to you.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="steps">
		<h4>Step 4: Get paid!</h4>
		<p>7 business days after a sale is complete, we'll send your money to the bank account associated with the credit/debit card you added upon sign-up.</p>
